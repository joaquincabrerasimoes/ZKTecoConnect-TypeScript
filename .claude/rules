# ZKTecoConnect-TypeScript - Development Rules

## TypeScript Standards
- Use strict mode (enabled in tsconfig.json)
- Define proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks

## Binary Protocol
- Follow existing packet structure conventions
- Use Buffer for all binary data handling
- Maintain checksum validation for all packets
- Document command codes in constants.ts

## Socket Management
- Properly clean up event listeners after operations
- Use configurable timeouts per command
- Track connection state
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks

## Data Format Handling
- Auto-detect packet format variations (device model differences)
- Handle variable-length data gracefully
- Provide fallbacks for unknown formats

## Code Organization
- Keep ZKTecoClient as main orchestrator
- Domain objects (User, Attendance) should be lightweight
- Utility functions in utils/ directory
- Constants and enums in others/ directory

## Testing
- Test against multiple device models if possible
- Verify checksum calculations
- Test timeout handling
